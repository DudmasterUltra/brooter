+ Distributed processing

Concurrent example:
```python
import br00ter

def test_password(password):
    print('testing ' + password)
    return (password, password == '12345')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with br00ter.FileGenerator('passlist.txt') as x:
    # with br00ter.TableGenerator('abc', 3, 5) as x:
        pool = br00ter.BrutePool(x, test_password)
        pool.start()
        pool.join()
        print(pool.get_positive_results())

```
